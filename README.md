# SlidingPuzzelGame_C_Old
Console game for Sliding Puzzle 
This project is about developing a sliding puzzle game. The sliding puzzle is a game composed of a number of pieces dispersed randomly along a board and one empty square. You can slide pieces by using the empty square. The objective is to rearrange these pieces to their original form where the distribution of pieces is on ascending order. 
 
Figure 1-a shows an example of sliding puzzle game with 15 pieces numbered randomly from 1 to 15 which lay in a square frame (4 rows x 4 columns). The goal is to rearrange these numbers in ascending order by sliding pieces using the free square as shown in figure 1-b. 
 
The score of the game is defined as the number of movements to solve the puzzle game.
